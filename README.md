# Free-Board-Game
The assembly instructions used for the freeboard game.
## Description
This project was my Junior Computer Engineering project with the goal to make a object avoidance game that uses a CPU we designed.
The CPU was designed via the Xilinx IDE in verilog. We then flashed the project to a Spartan 3 board and hooked in VGA and 
accelerometer peripherals.

## CPU/ALU
The verilog code for the CPU/ALU is found here: [Free-Board-CPU](https://github.com/dustycodes/Free-Board-CPU)

## Assembler
The C# code for the Assembler is found here: [Free-Board-Assembler](https://github.com/dustycodes/Free-Board-Assembler)

## Game Instructions, Logistics, Maps, and Tests
The assembly code for the game is found here: [Free-Board-Game](https://github.com/dustycodes/Free-Board-Game)
